# Testing

## Product

- Product is four stand-alone modules
- Every module provides two functions
- Module - calculations for figures
- Functions calculates the result of the math formula 

## Purpose
- Catch the defects 
- Make sure that working correct

## Scope

- triangle.py
  - area
  - perimeter
- circle.py
  - area
  - perimeter
- rectangle.py
  - area
  - perimeter
- square.py
  - area
  - perimeter

## Tests
- For every module there are the test class, ex:
    - circle_tests.py
        - CircleTestCase
- Test class contains tests for functions of this module
- There are one module which can execute all tests for all modules
